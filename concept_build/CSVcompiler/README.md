# CSVcompiler

The CSV Compiler reads in some CSV generated by Tabula for some pages of the
Ohlone catalog and generates a JSON object with that resulting information.

### How do I compile an Ohlone Catalog?

Prepare a PDF of the pages you would like to scrape
from.


 - First download <a href = "https://tabula.technology/">Tabula</a>.
 - Run Tabula on your pages of the catalog (importing them) and place one selection on the left side of the page and the other selection on the right side of the page. Repeat the selections.

 - Extract your data to a CSV file and place into a local folder next to compiler.py. (If you're curious what your file should look like, checkout the sample data.csv file)
 - Run the following line in your terminal (replacing the names with your CSV and output JSON file):
 ```
 python3 compiler.py data.csv data.json
 ```
