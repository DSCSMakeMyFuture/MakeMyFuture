### <u>For MakeMyFuture Developers</u>

Welcome to ./MakeMyFuture! Whether you're working on client-side, server-side, or some other role, your work is appreciated! This quick tutorial will get you setup with everything you need to get the project working on your computer, regardless of what operating system your on. For starters: follow the steps below.

1. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Download and install git (the terminal tool, just click through the install tool (make sure to have git bash installed), the default options are fine)</a>
2. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Download and install NodeJS, again defaults are fine</a>
3. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Download and install an IDE, most members prefer VSCode</a>
4. <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Make an account on MongoDB, Click through the defaults until you have a database up and ready to go</a>
5. Open VSCode, Start a new terminal and navigate to a folder in which you would like to download the repository (You can use ```cd Downloads``` to move to your Downloads folder), and run the following command to download the repository (If you're on Windows, you may need to specifically open a git bash terminal by using the plus sign)
```
git clone https://github.com/dot-slash-cs/MakeMyFuture
```
6. Use File > Open Folder... in VSCode to now navigate to your downloaded folder. Open a terminal again (Using Terminal > New Terminal) (Git bash if needed) and run the following commands to install needed dependencies and start the server.
```
npm install
node app.js
```
7. Open a new browser tab/window and go to localhost:3000 to see the webpage! Check out the files in the folder to see what sort of code already exists.
